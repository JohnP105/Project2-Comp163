# COMP 163 (Database Management Systems) - Healthcare Database

## Description

Project 2 involves working in teams of 2 to 3 members to implement database tables within a chosen domain using ElephantSQL. The project emphasizes collaboration and teamwork, with each member required to upload the project results independently. The project consists of two main objectives: creating and populating database tables and optimizing a slow query.

## Objective 1: Database Table Creation and Population

For this objective, the team designed and implemented two database tables relevant to their chosen domain. At least one attribute in one of the tables was encrypted using PostgreSQL's encryption functions. The tables were populated with a significant amount of data to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Objective 2: Query Optimization

The second objective focused on optimizing a slow query from Objective 1 to execute significantly faster, aiming for a runtime of approximately one second or less. Strategies for optimization included indexing, query refinement, and considering distributed databases where applicable.

### Installation (How to run the project)

1. Create a virtual environment (if not created already):
   - Mac Users: `python3 -m venv venv`
   - Window Users: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Mac Users: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - Window Users: `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install required modules: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
